# Flexxible

This project aims to replicate the core functionality of Dribbble, a popular platform for designers and creatives to showcase their work. Our clone includes features such as project creation and editing, user profile management, project exploration, and secure user authentication.

## Features

- User Profiles: Users can create and manage their profiles, including profile pictures and descriptions.

- Project Management: Users can upload and edit their creative projects, providing details, images, and descriptions.

- Project Exploration: Users can browse a curated collection of projects, filter them, and view project details.

- Authentication: We offer two different authentication methods:

- Google Authentication: Users can securely sign in with their Google accounts.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): We use JWT for traditional email/password-based authentication.
- Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
